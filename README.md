**Aim:**

1. Create Dataset for 2 classes
2. Two approaches
	Raw image pixels to cluster the images
	Feature vector from pretrained CNN network to cluster the images 
3. Cluster the given set of images into 2 clusters using point no 2
3. Find the centroid of the created clusters
4. Given new examples, check if it is out of distribution based on the distance metric
